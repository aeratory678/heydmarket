Welcome to **heydmarket** — a 90s-style parody black market storefront built for fun, nostalgia, and summer hackathons! Inspired by retro aesthetics, shell-based currencies, and tongue-in-cheek humor, this site delivers a playful shopping experience reminiscent of the early web era.

## Features

- **Retro 90s UI:** Comic Sans, rainbow marquees, table borders, and classic GIF-style flourishes.
- **Product Grid:** Browse a selection of parody tech products and meme items.
- **Order System:** Quantity controls, balance check, insufficient funds warnings, and fake checkout.
- **Loader Animation:** Simulates a queue with an animated loader and estimated wait time.
- **Parody Virus Popup:** "Your computer may be at risk!" — just for fun, not real malware.
- **Visitor Counter:** Shows a (fake) visitor count for that authentic 90s touch.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across devices, with grid layouts for mobile and desktop.
- **Just for Fun:** No real purchases, no real currency, no real downloads.
